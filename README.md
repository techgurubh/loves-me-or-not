# 🌸 Loves Me... Loves Me Not: Neon Glass Edition

An interactive, high-fidelity web application based on the classic flower petal game. Seek your fortune in love with a procedurally generated digital daisy.

## 🕹️ Gameplay
- **Pluck Petals:** Click or tap individual petals to "pluck" them.
- **Dynamic Fate:** Every round is unique. The game generates a random number of petals (between 5 and 15), so the final result is never predictable.
- **Emoji Feedback:** The flower's center reacts to your progress:
  - 🤔 *Thinking...* (New Game)
  - 😊 *Loves Me!*
  - 😟 *Loves Me Not...*
  - 💖/💔 *The Final Verdict*

## ✨ Features
- **Glassmorphism UI:** Frosted glass effect with intense CSS backdrop filters.
- **Neon Particle System:** 150+ custom particles with motion blur and neon glows.
- **Fluid Animation:** Physics-based "falling petal" effect using Canvas API.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both mobile browsers and desktop displays.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- `index.html`: Project structure and glassmorphism containers.

- `script.js`: Particle engine, petal physics, and game logic.
